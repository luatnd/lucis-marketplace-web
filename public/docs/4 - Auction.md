### Step 1 - Set Start Price & End Date

A start price is the price from which bidders start bidding, and the first bid is required to be 5% more than the start price. If you are not sure how much the start price should be, you can search for similar NFTs auctioning on LucisNFT and decide based on others’ prices.

An end date specifies when the auction ends. You can select from 1 day, 3 days, and 5 days later.

### Step 2 - Approval for NFT

After the **Start Listing** button is clicked, you will be guide to finish an approval operation.

Same like Fixed Price Listing, **Approval** is like giving the LucisNFT the permission to transfer your NFT to someone else. Don’t worry, no real transfer would happen at this moment. When someone placed a bid for your NFT, the contract of LucisNFT would then transfer your NFT to the auction contract immediately to make sure the item is safe before the auction ends.

Approval is a one-time only operation for each NFT collection.

### Step 3 - Start Auction

After the approval, you will be prompt by your wallet to finish a signing. After then your auction would be listed on the market in a few seconds.

The signing takes no fee, and is used to verify that you are the owner of the listing NFT.

All your auctions are listed in the **On Sale** section of your Profile.

**The only case that you can cancel your on-going auction is that when no bids is placed yet.**

### Step 4 - Auction Ends with Bids

There are two ways to end an auction:

-   The auction’s time goes out;
-   Manually end the auction before time goes out.

Once an auction ends, the last bid wins.The auction item (your NFT) and the bid payment will be transferred to each other automatically.
